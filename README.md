# Desktop-Voice-Assistant
Introduction:
In this project model, we will explore the implementation of a basic voice assistant that can recognize speech input, process commands, and generate spoken responses. By utilizing natural language processing techniques and integrating with external APIs for functionalities like weather updates, news retrieval, or task management, the voice assistant can become a versatile tool for users.
Features:
We have imported tinkter and created a GUI interface which gives the access to the ask function where microphone is enabled and we can give the commands by speech and there is a send function where we can write the command on the input console and it gives the reply back by the speech.It can also acess to the webbrowser and access to all the websites in it.
Requirements:
tkinter
google recogniser module
pytssx3 module
pil module
How to acesss:
To run this we open vs code and run the code and output console will be displayed and our created GUI interface is enabled and we can access to its functions.
